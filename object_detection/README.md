# Tensorflow Object Detection API
I have cloned and modified (deleted some files) of Tensorflow Object Detection API to adapt it to my repo.

The original API is written for TF 1.x, but I adapted it to TF 2.x.

See [the original Tensorflow Object Detection API repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
